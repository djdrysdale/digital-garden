# About Me
My name is David Drysdale. I’m a digital design strategist and researcher based in London, Ontario, Canada. My background’s a bit eclectic: I completed a PhD in English Literature but didn’t like the long odds on the academic job market. So, I left academia for roles including consulting researcher, content marketing editor, and business analyst before finding my footing as a design strategist.

Now I lead a team of strategists and researchers for a large corporation in the insurance and financial services industry.

## About Moby direction

It’s probably most accurate to describe Moby Diction as a blog. It’s a place in which I can process information I’ve been consuming, work through different ideas I’m playing with, and exercise my writing craft.

I’ve blogged or written online before in various formats, but this iteration of my site came as a result of three different insights that I’ve had.

I feel compelled to share knowledge. This came from work I did with a career coach a few years ago. She observed that I was unhappiest with my work when I felt unable to act as an internal “thought leader” or fulfill my drive to teach or share insights.

I hoard information. I’m an inveterate learner. I read a lot and was learning a lot. Often, I was inspired by what I read. But, this was almost purely consumption. And, I often felt frustrated because I didn’t have an outlet to share or use what I was learning. I had something of value, but couldn’t see a way to actualize it.

Personal knowledge management is a thing. I recently read [Sönke Ahrens](https://takesmartnotes.com/)’ excellent [How to Take Smart Notes](https://amzn.to/3b0JfgC). The book was a revelation for me. It introduced me to how the slipbox or zettelkasten method of knowledge management fosters serendipitous connections between ideas. It also led me to Tiago Forte’s [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/) course, which has given me a framework for acting on those connections, as well as emphasizing to me the value of curation and of sharing information.

Moby Diction was borne of recognizing my personal need to share with my discovery of a framework that helped me act on it.
