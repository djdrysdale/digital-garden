"Chesterton's Fence" is a heuristic used to illustrate the importance of second-order thinking. The name of the heuristic is a reference to a passage from G. K. Chesteron: 

> There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, “I don’t see the use of this; let us clear it away.” To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: “If you don’t see the use of it, I certainly won’t let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.

Chesterton's Fence suggests the importance of thinking through the second-order consequences of our actions. In other words, what are the consequences of the consequences of our decisions? Chesterton tells us not to remove a fence unless we know why it was put there in the first place. There may have been a good reason. 

The original context of the quote is from *The Thing,* Chesterton's 1929 defense of Catholicism; it's very much a classically conservative argument, an admonition against reformers who, from Chesterton's point of view, demand change from a position of ignorance. Yet, as Rory Sutherland implies, it's advice that may be worth keeping in mind in the age of Silicon Valley and its insatiable appetite for disruption.
