Narratives, alone or in constellation with one another, produce real-world effects. People use narratives to help them interpret events. As [[Kahnemann]] and Tversky outline in their model of the "representativeness heuristic," stories frame people's expectations and therefore inform how they will behave. 

[[≈ Shiller - Narrative Economics|Robert Shiller]] describes how [[¶ Economic narrative (Shiller)|narratives]] inform individual economic actions, such as when and where to invest or whether to take a certain job. But, a story that is virulent enough can have mass-scale impacts. For instance, narratives in the latter half of the twentieth century that used efficiency to describe free markets helped contribute to a public reaction against regulation and government intervention in the economy.
