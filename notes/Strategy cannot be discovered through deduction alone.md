A strategy is a hypothesis: based on [[Strategic diagnosis is a clear, honest description of the challenge at hand|a strategic diagnosis of the situation]], it proposes actions that are believed to create an advantage for the organization. 

Because strategy is (generally) produced under conditions of [[Different kinds of uncertainty|uncertainty]], it cannot be generated through [[¶ Deductive reasoning|deductive reasoning]] alone. Rather, it requires [[¶ Abductive reasoning|abductive reasoning]] to produce the key insights that emerge through effective sensemaking and diagnosis. Deduction cannot produce new ideas; it assumes a computational model of reality that does not line up with [[Situations of radical uncertainty cannot be resolved through probabilistic thinking alone|the kind of radical uncertainty]] that characterizes the world. 

This is not to say that strategy is not empirical; on the contrary, any good strategy is but a hypothesis that can be tested. But arriving at that hypothesis takes more than deduction.
