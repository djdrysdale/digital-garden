An effective strategy is honest about the challenge ahead. Bad strategy skirts past the true nature of the challenge and its uncomfortable details in order to placate the interests of others. It tries to be everything to everyone, sweeping over difficulty with broad generalizations and the shiny language of blue-sky vision statements and empty buzzwords. 

Strategy must accurately depict the challenge the organization faces. Defining this challenge honestly and clearly is critical to the success. Only then can strategy begin to do its work of defining a feasible bridge to overcome it. 

This is the work of the [[Strategic diagnosis is a clear, honest description of the challenge at hand]]: it's a kind of [[¶ Sensemaking (Madsbjerg)]] activity that ensures everyone understands the work that needs to be done.
