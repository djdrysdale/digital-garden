While ux researchers are generally less concerned with [[Qualitative researchers care more about data saturation than sample size|sample size]] than quantitative researchers, they should be mindful of strength of evidence. 

As [[Hodgson - User Experience Research and Strength of Evidence|Philip Hodgson]] outlines, a researcher can collect good data and bad data. An individual's opinion about a design is bad data; observing an individual struggle with a design as part of a contextual data is good data. Generally speaking, the closer we are to observing the user engaged in their natural behaviour, the stronger the evidence.

Hodgson says that a researcher should strive to collect data that is *valid*, meaning that it actually measures what we are trying to measure, and *reliable*, meaning that another researcher performing the same study would come to the same result.
