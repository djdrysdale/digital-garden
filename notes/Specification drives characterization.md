Specificity is the heart of effective characterization. As a character is drawn, the layering of specific details helps define the character through the affirmation and rejection of possible characteristics. According to Saunders, attention to specificity should in turn create opportunities for "meaningful action."The greater the specificity, the greater the opportunity for meaningful action. 

But this can be manipulated with significant effects: the more specific a character, the less able a reader might be to identify with them.
