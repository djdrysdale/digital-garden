In a digital world, demographic information has little meaning. Everyone is a demographic of one. As early as the mid-1990s, Nicholas Negroponte was making this argument, but we haven't internalized it yet. But in a digital environment, we are all demographics of one: our experience can be tailored not to the generalized behaviours of people our age, but to our exact actions. As Negroponte put it, "thinking of the post-information age as infinitesimal demographics or ultrafocused narrowcasting is about as personalized as Burger King's 'Have It Your Way.'"
