title: Prototypes help test refined ideas

description: Rushing to test a prototype too soon can lead to polishing a concept that actually won't solve the root problem. Use prototypes to test refined ideas, not raw ideas.

In design, it can be tempting to rush to develop a prototype to get "real" feedback on an idea. Erika Hall posits that this is because a prototype, no matter how low fidelity, feels tangible: it provides physical, concrete evidence of progress. 

But a prototype assumes you're already answering the right question. If you rush to a prototype, you may end up polishing a concept that won't solve anyone's problem to begin with. 

Instead of rushing to a prototype, spend more time in the problem space.
