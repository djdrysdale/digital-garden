Resilient strategy is an idea I am kicking around that describes using strategy and foresight to promote sustainable businesses and organizations that are primed for resilience, durability, and longevity. Contrary to [[¶ Presentism]] sustainable strategy is a long game. 

(NB: I originally called this "sustainable strategy"; I think "resilient strategy" is a better term for what I am trying to articulate.)

## Adapting to change
- [[Change happens gradually, then suddenly.]]
- [[Change is disorienting because it is constant]]
- [[Established organizations tend to optimize for inertia]]
- [[Strategic inflection points disrupt the underlying assumptions of a business or industry]]
- [[Resilience has a modifiable set point]]

## Foresight
- [[Amy Webb’s method for finding the future]]
- [[CIPHER method for trendspotting]]
- [[Future trends emerge when a fundamental human need is met by a new enabling technology.]]
- [[Inflection points reveal themselves first at the edges]]
- [[Market research is a poor tool for trendspotting]]
- [[Our models for understanding dynamic situation should undergo constant revision.]]
- [[Our vision of the future is always constrained by our view of the past.]]
- [[Qualitative research creates mental models about the problem space.]]
- [[Strategic inflection points develop over four stages]]
- [[Think about the future across multiple planes and timezones]]

## Innovation
- [[Common innovation anti-patterns]]
- [[Common myths about innovation]]
- [[Corporate innovation means discovering sustainable new business models]]
- [[De-risk innovation by making smaller bets]]
- [[Innovation accrues in small, incremental steps.]]
- [[Innovation thrives in open environments]]

## Operations
- [[Lean methodologies promote velocity at the expense of understanding]]
- [[Loss aversion creates tension between the need to innovate and the need to protect the status quo in large organizations]]
- [[Managers craft safe environments for their people]]
- [[Protect dissent]]
- [[Traditional road maps force companies into confirmation bias]]
- [[Design environments to facilitate behaviours]]

## Sustainability mindset
- [[Ethical design requires a new definition of business value]]
- [[¶ Existential flexibility]]
- [[¶ Finite and infinite games]]
- [[Fixating on metric data biases us to the short term]]
- [[Focusing too narrowly on efficiency creates risk]]
- [[Measuring performance stymies organizational intimacy]]
- [[Metric fixation is a symptom of a decline in social trust]]
- [[Organizations have become primarily focused on short-term results]]
- [[Organizations should align around a clear strategic focus]]
- [[¶ Triple bottom line]]
- [[Sustainable strategy cannot be easily replicated]]

## Uncertainty
- [[Different kinds of uncertainty]]
- [[¶ Radical uncertainty (King and Kay)]]
- [[¶ Sensemaking (Madsbjerg)]]
