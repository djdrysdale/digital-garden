CS Peirce outlined four offenses that we commit when we reason. As recounted by Madsbjerg, these offenses are: 

1) we make an absolute assertion that we are right; 
2) we think that something’s not knowable simply because we lack the means to know it; 
3) we insist that something is inexplicable; and 
4) we we believe that any truth exists in a final state.
