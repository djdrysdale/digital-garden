"Issue, rule, analysis, conclusion," or IRAC, is a methodology for legal analysis but one that is useful in any situation in which one needs to find practical knowledge. 

- "Issue" refers to establishing the issue at hand amid disparate, uncertain information. (See [[Spend more time in the problem space]].)
- "Rule" means identifying the legal principles most relevant to the case;
- "Analysis" refers to describing how the rules apply to the specific at hand;  and
- "Conclusion" describes the ultimate recommendation based on the analysis

This methodology seems functional for work involving [[Situations of radical uncertainty cannot be resolved through probabilistic thinking alone|situations of high uncertainty]] in general, where "wicked problems" require [[¶ Sensemaking (Madsbjerg)|sensemaking]] of diverse data and a problem cannot be easily reduced to [[Different kinds of uncertainty|expected certainty]] or probabilities.
