The purpose of qualitative research is to build a deep understanding of the problem space. Qualitative researchers are looking to understand *why* a phenomenon might exist, and to understand how people relate to a phenomenon. As Schuler puts it, qualitative research helps us understand things we don't already know, how people think and feel, and the factors that inform their behaviour. 

Quantitative research, on the other hand, looks to quantify the presence of something we think we already know. It measures how much, how often, and how many. It's less useful for uncovering emotions, motivations, goals, or for building a high-level sense of the research space. 

Qualitative research is focused, narrow, and deep; quantitative research is broad but shallow. If you have a specific question to answer, you probably want a quantitative  method; if you have an open-ended question, use a qualitative method.
