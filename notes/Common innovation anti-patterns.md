There are a number of common anti-patterns among large organizations that stifle innovation. These include:
- expecting innovators to just come up with “[[¶ Innovation theater|cool stuff]]” without a guiding objective or strategy; 
- forcing innovators to spend too much time building long-term business cases and projection;  
- making arbitrary or capricious decisions; 
- preventing innovators from talking to customers; 
- not allocating sufficient resources; 
- preventing teams from releasing MVPs out of fear of the impact to the brand; and 
- forcing teams to adhere to rigid expectations in spite of new learning or discoveries made through [[De-risk innovation by making smaller bets|experimentation and iteration]].
