## Summary
Innovation doesn't emerge in a flash of sudden insight, but through a longer, ongoing process across networks of adjacent possibilities. Silos and walls inhibit innovation; ideas spread more quickly in open environments that makes them accessible to others who can react to and build on them. In this way, ideas can be quickly recontextualized and connected in surprising ways, promoting serendipity. 

Johnson draws heavily on biological metaphors to describe how creativity and innovation emerge. For example, the [[¶ Adjacent possible|adjacent possible]] is a biological [[Metaphors structure our interpretation of the world|metaphor]]. 

## Notes
- [[Innovation thrives in open environments]]
- [[¶ Adjacent possible]]
- [[Innovation accrues in small, incremental steps.]]
- [[Ideas are networks]]
- [[Ideas are remixes]]
- [[Fostering serendipity]]
- [[Optimize to be wrong, not right]]
- [[¶ Expatation]]
- [[Strength of weak ties]]
