Good research needs to start with a good question. Without a clear question to guide inquiry, research will end up churning and pursuing leads that may be interesting but that don't contribute to finding a solution. 

The question doesn't need necessarily to be precise; as Erika Hall puts it, an early question might be "We need to understand what other people think about *x*." But as the question become further refined, the research will become more targeted and therefore more useful.
