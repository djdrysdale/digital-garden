Conway's Law, coined in 1967 by programmer Melvin Conway, states that organizations create systems that mirror their internal communications structures. That is, the system is isomorphic to the conditions of its creation.

Others have extended this general principle to some of its consequences. In 1999, Nigel Bevan observed that "organizations often produce web sites with a content and structure which mirrors the internal concerns of the organization rather than the needs of the users of the site."
