Personas tend to be shallow. They rely heavily on superficial demographic information but lack contextual information that indicates *why* the persona sought a solution to their problem in the first place. This gap leaves the brain unsatisfied: the narrative is incomplete. When the brain encounters these kinds of gaps, it subconsciously fills them in with assumptions to help explain causality. 

As a result, personas can lead to teams misunderstanding their users, and even having diverging interpretations of what the user needs, since different team members will likely draw on different sets of experiences to fill the information gap.
