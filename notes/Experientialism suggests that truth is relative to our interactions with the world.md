The experientialist approach provides a "third way" between objectivism and subjectivism. It acknowledges that no vantage point provides us with the objective truth of or experiences. However, it rejects the idea that there is no truth. Instead, it positions truth as being relative to our conceptual system, something that is constantly tested and re-evaluated through our experiences and interactions with others and with the world around us. Objectivity is relative to how a culture conceives of reality. In other words, in the words of Lakoff and Johnson, "we understand the world through our interactions with it." Truth derives from understanding.
