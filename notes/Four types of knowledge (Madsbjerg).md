Madsbjerg identifies four types of knowledge: 

1) **Objective knowledge**. Objective knowledge forms the basis of the natural sciences. This is the world of concrete, observable, and measurable facts. Things either are or are not; conditions can be evaluated against simple tests that will consistently yield the same results.
2) **Subjective knowledge**. Subjective knowledge comprises our personal thoughts and feelings, and includes our knowledge of ourselves and our experiences. 
3) **Shared knowledge**. Shared knowledge covers the way we collectively feel—our joint mood as a society.
4) **Sensory knowledge**. Sensory knowledge directs our lower-level understanding of the world. This includes our intuition—that feeling when we are able to anticipate something before it happens. 

No one form of knowledge is inherently superior to any other.
