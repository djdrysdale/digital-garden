Brands work by erecting structures of memory in the mind of a consumer or buyer. A brand is a constellation of these impressions that accrete over time. A successful brand uses these impressions to ensure that it is a presence in the consumer's consideration set; that is, a brand is successful if it persists in the buyer's memory when making a buying decision, fulfilling the requirements for brand salience in a consumer decision. A brand must be distinctive enough to be easy to identify when the consumer is looking for it. People don't actually think about brands that much; the brand, therefore, must embed itself in their unconscious choices. 

Advertising serves to reify these memory structures in the consumer's mind.
