"What is going on here?" here refers to what King and Kay suggest is the fundamental question to ask when encountering any situation in which information may be limited, uncertain, or volatile. It's meant to point to the need to build a more comprehensive, holistic understanding of situations of [[¶ Radical uncertainty (King and Kay)|radical uncertainty]] than what can be provided by [[Situations of radical uncertainty cannot be resolved through probabilistic thinking alone|probabilistic thinking]]. "What is going on here," King and Kay argue, can only be answered with [[Sensemaking produces thick data|thick description]] of the sort that Madsbjerg suggests is produced by [[¶ Sensemaking (Madsbjerg)|sensemaking]]. It's not information that can be reduced to numbers; it requires communication via [[Narrative helps the human mind make sense of events|narrative]].

"What is going on here" seems to be another framing of the orientation phase of the [[¶ OODA Loop]] and in particular. See [[The orientation phase of OODA is where the greatest risk and opportunity lies]].
