Good strategy simplifies. It is focused around a limited number of critical insights. When it's done well it will look obvious. But that's because it has brought clarity and simplicity to a complex, dynamic problem space. It's a narrative that simplifies complexity, drawing attention toward some facets of the issue and away from others while pointing to the appropriate domain of action. Rumelt describes a strategic diagnosis as a "simplified model of reality." 

This is the essence of strategy: it determines the right fulcrum point and then applies the appropriate pressure required to move an object. It creates leverage.
