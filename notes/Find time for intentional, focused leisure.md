While today we have more leisure time than ever before, that time is fragmented by countless small tasks—checking email, responding to a text message—that make us feel like we have less time than we do. Multitasking in this way compromises the quality and benefits of our leisure time by constantly bringing work to top of mind. Researcher Brigid Schulte describes this effect as "time confetti"; lost seconds and minutes add up and have a significant, collective effect. 

It's valuable to devote time to distraction-free leisure that is uninterrupted by notifications and alerts.
