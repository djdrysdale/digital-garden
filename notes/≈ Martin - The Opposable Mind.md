## Summary
The most successful leaders practice what Martin calls "integrative thinking": an approach to problem-solving that embraces complexity and eschews binary, either/or thinking. Integrative thinkers are able to consider the problem holistically, rather than as a series of discrete decisions or trade-offs, and adopt a broad view of salience to develop unique, creative approaches to the problem space. 

## Notes

### Integrative thinking
- [[Qualities of an integrative thinker]]
- [[Put mental models in conversation with one another]]
- [[Perspective comprises our stance, our tools, and our experience]]

### Salience 
- [[Salience is subjective]]
- [[Specialization narrows our perspective on what is salient to a problem]]
