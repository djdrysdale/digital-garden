Qualitative research helps us build mental models about the contexts, problems, and motivations our products and designs must account for. It helps us understand what is important at a high level—what matters to people and how they understand their relationship to the world. 

The questions are more open-ended. When we do qualitative research, we're trying to synthesize a narrative about our subject. It's closer to [[Sensemaking MOC]] than quantitative methods: it builds a perspective based on the available evidence that can later be measured through quantitative methods.

A strong foundation of qualitative research can help us have a better intuition about people and culture.
