## Summary
Rumelt argues that having a strategy is itself a competitive advantage, in that few organizations actually have strategies. Strategy depends on a three-part kernel consisting of a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and of coordinated action.

## Notes

### The nature of strategy
- [[Strategy unflinchingly identifies the nature of the challenge ahead]]
- [[Strategy creates advantage by generating new perspectives]]
- [[Strategy requires rejecting some good opportunities in favour of others]]
- [[Strategy is more design than decision-making]]
- [[Sustainable strategy cannot be easily replicated]]
- [[Strategy cannot be discovered through deduction alone]]

### The kernel of strategy
- [[Strategy revolves around a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.]]
	- [[Strategic diagnosis is a clear, honest description of the challenge at hand]]
	- [[Guiding policy is a general approach to overcoming a challenge]]
	- [[Strategy defines coherent action -- a set of coordinated moves that enact a guiding principle]]

### Inertia and entropy in organizations
- [[Established organizations tend to optimize for inertia]]
- [[Entropy forces organizations to waste energy on alignment]]
- [[Chain link systems cannot be improved by focusing on one link alone]]
