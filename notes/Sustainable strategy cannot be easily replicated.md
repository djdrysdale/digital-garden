For a strategy to be sustainable over the long-term, it must be one that cannot be easily replicated by a competitor, or one that is based on resources that they cannot easily replicate or acquire. The strategy should be based on an "isolating mechanism," like unique intellectual property or patents; brand or reputation; network effects; or tacit knowledge acquired only through experience.
