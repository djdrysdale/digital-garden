1) Reach: Prioritize reaching as many customers as possible as cost-effectively as possible, ensuring coverage of light or non-buyers. 
2) Be easy to buy: Understand how consumers buy and fit into their lives; mitigate potential barriers to buying.
3) Get noticed: Be on the shelf. Make the ad get noticed. Remember that customers avoid advertising. 
4) ???
5) Be distinctive: Being distinctive enables loyalty and allows you refresh memory structures for your brand. 
6) Be consistent: You can’t be distinctive if you are not consistent. 
7) Be competitive: Don’t give consumers a reason not to buy.
