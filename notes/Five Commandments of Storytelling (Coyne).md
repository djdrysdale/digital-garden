In his *Story Grid* approach to writing a novel, Shawn Coyne lists five commandments that he argues are essential to effective fiction. These elements, he says, determine whether or not a scene works: 

1. **Inciting Incident**: An event or disturbance that sets the scene into action
2. **Progressive Complication  / Turning Point**: The action or revelation that forces the POV character to make a decision
3. **Crisis**: The viewpoint character is forced to make a decision that will result in a bad outcome no matter what they do, or that will benefit them and harm others. This decision is critical to make the character active instead of passive. 
4. **Climax**: The action the character takes as a result of the crisis decision. This results in a (possibly) slight shift in values that provide purpose to the scene. 
5. **Resolution**: The outcome of the climax. The resolution should signify some change; if not, one of the other commandments might be missing.
