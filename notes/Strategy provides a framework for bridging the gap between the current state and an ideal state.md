Strategy provides a framework of principles and decisions that help the organization move closer to an idealized future state. Its purpose is to help guide the team along via the path that is most likely to ensure success en route to realizing the vision and accomplishing the mission of the organization. 

Decisions made as part of a strategy [[Strategy manufactures constraints|should create constraints]] by defining what is valuable, what is valued, and what is off the table for the team or organization. 

A strategy is informed by the mission and vision, and in turn informs the road map: the concrete steps that will bring the strategy to life.
