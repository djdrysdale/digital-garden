Ideas are networks: they emerge as clusters of neurons firing together to form a conscious thought. A hunch may be the first, germinal stage of innovation; but, over periods of time, they accrue connections—mutating, evolving, growing stronger—until they catalyze into thought.

These networks need to be both densely populated and plastic—that is, capable of adapting and reconfiguring themselves as conditions change and as new adjacent possibilities reveal themselves.
