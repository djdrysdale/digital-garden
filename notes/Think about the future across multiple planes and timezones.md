The futurist considers scenarios across three planes: the probable, or what is likely should current patterns continue; the plausible, based on what other experimentation is conceivable given what we know of the laws of science and humanity; and the possible, things that seem far-fetched today but may become possible in the future. 

When thinking about the future, we should think in terms of different timezones, ranging from the immediate future—within the next year—to the distant future—more than thirty years hence.

How quickly trends evolve and change is a factor of evens that are taking place now, and what is likely to transpire in the future. These include various dimensions of our everyday life: wealth distribution, education, government, politics, public health, demography, economy, environment, and media.
