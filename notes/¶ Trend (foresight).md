Amy Webb defines a trend as “a new manifestation of sustained change…. A starting point that helps us to simultaneously meet the demands of the present while planning for the future.” Trends occur when basic human needs are met with a catalyzing technology. But, they can be difficult to spot, emerging as constellations

Trends are more than technology. Webb writes that “a trend is driven by a basic human need, one that is catalyzed by new technology.” Trends are persistent—they are not fads. And they continue to mutate and evolve as they move from the fringe to the mainstream. They begin as a series of disclosed fragments but slowly, through collision and fusion, combine into something much bigger, much more significant.
