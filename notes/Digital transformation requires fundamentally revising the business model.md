Many organizations are going about digital transformation the wrong way: they don’t recognize that it means fundamentally revisiting your business model from a customer-first perspective. Common approaches, like [[Integrate innovation functions with the broader organization|setting up innovation teams or labs]], aren’t capable of tackling the fundamental, organization-wide shift in mindset that needs to happen. Indeed, many organizations look simply to digitize their existing practices; but, this is not sufficient for real transformation. Real transformation means reexamining how the organization creates value and why, not just digitizing what the organization already does.
