In general, there are three types of [[Personas document shared understanding about users|persona]]: proto-personas, qualitative personas, and statistical (or mixed-method) personas. 

Proto-personas can spell out the assumptions a team has about users in the [[Personas communicate research or they communicate assumptions|absence of research]]. Because they're not research-based, their prone to inaccuracy, but can be better than nothing in organizations with a low level of UX maturity or in an [[Lean methodologies promote velocity at the expense of understanding|Lean UX environment]] where [[Qualitative researchers care more about data saturation than sample size|frequent testing and iteration will take place]].

Qualitative personas are based on [[Personas start with qualitative research|qualitative discovery research]] and [[Personas make abstract research concrete for design teams|document patterns]] in user needs, pain points, workflows, and tasks. Qualitative personas strike a nice balance between effort—they may require [[There is no set formula to determine an appropriate sample size for qualitative research.|as few as 5 interviews per user group]]—and value. However, due to [[How many users should you interview|a small sample size]], they might miss out some perspectives. Moreover, they may not indicate how representative an identified segment might be. 

Statistical or mixed-method personas build on qualitative personas. Statistical personas use quantitative methods, like surveys, to validate qualitative findings and [[Qualitative research seeks contextual understanding while qualitative research quantifies the presence of something|identify statistical patterns]]. This adds a veneer of scientific rigour to personas and provides assurance that the personas are statistically representative. However, the creation of statistical personas is far more time consuming than the other methods and may yield only incremental benefits.
