[[Qualitative researchers care more about data saturation than sample size]]. This makes it difficult to estimate up front how many samples or participants will be necessary for a qualitative study. 

Seaman and Yocco have each suggested that the number of users interviewed may vary depending on factors:

- the scope of the project, meaning the extent to which the results will be applied, will have the greatest bearing on the sample size; a familiar problem space will require fewer participants than an unfamiliar one
- the diversity of participants will increase the number you need to sample
- the experience of the researcher may reduce the required sample size
