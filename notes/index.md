Welcome to my digital notebook.

This is (roughly) my digital [[§ Zettelkasten|zettelkasten]], a collection of interlinked [[¶ Principle of atomicity|atomic notes]] about anything that interests me. In general, they will talk about strategy, research, UX, product development, learning, and knowledge management, but might stray pretty far afield from that sometimes.

Consider this my "digital garden." It's hobby work. I collect ideas that I am interested in, and I try to cultivate them as best I can. (Not sure where to get started? Try the [[_Index]]).
