"Metric fixation" describes a set of beliefs that contribute to our culture’s obsession with measured data. This attitude includes a faith that we can and should replace human judgment with quantified performance data; that the publication of quantified data provides assurance that individuals or groups will carry out what is expected of them; and that human beings can be best motivated by associating rewards and penalties to measured performance.
