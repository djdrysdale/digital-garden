"Brand" is more than the colours, the imagery, the voice, or the *look* of that an organization or individual puts forward; "brand" describes the gestalt impression that develops through every point of contact an individual has with that brand. A brand is a constellation of impressions that accretes over time; it drives whatever expectations an individual might when engaging with the brand. 

Effective branding grows the value of a product or service to the organization offering it in that a consumer may be willing—all other things being equal—to select one offering over another, or pay a premium for one offering over another. 

- [[Advertising changes the cultural meaning of products]]: People attach to brands that help them signify to others in particular ways and are therefore an expression of self-identity
