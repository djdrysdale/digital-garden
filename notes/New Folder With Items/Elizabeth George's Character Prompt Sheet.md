In *Mastering the Process: From Idea to Novel*, Elizabeth George offers a prompt sheet that she uses to help her develop characters. The prompt sheet is a prompt, not a form; it should be used to prompt stream-of-consciousness freewriting about the character being considered. It's not intended as a rigid set of requirements.
