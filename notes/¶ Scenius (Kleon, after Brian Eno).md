The idea of the lone creative is a bit of a myth. Instead, creativity often emerges in networks of people sharing their ideas and knowledge with one another. These groups--described by Brian Eno as "scenius"â€”forms what Austin Kleon calls an "ecology of talent." In other words, creativity rarely emerges from a vacuum; its always some form of collaboration.
