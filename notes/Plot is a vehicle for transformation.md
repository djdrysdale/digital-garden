The purpose of storytelling is not to execute the plot. The plot should be the vehicle through which a character undergoes transformation. The plot should force the protagonist to confront their critical flaw and ultimately undergo change as a result. The entire plot should act as a kind of crucible of change, through which the status quo (presented in Act One) is disrupted and the character is forced to confront their own flaw (mid point) and achieve a new equilibrium (resolution).
