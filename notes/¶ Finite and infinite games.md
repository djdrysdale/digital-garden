"Finite and infinite games" describe the distinctions between situations in which there are contained, clear rules, players and limited outcomes (finite games) and those without any of those aspects. The concept comes from James P. Carse's *Finite and Infinite Games: A Vision of Life as Play and Possibility* (1986). Carse observes that finite games are played only to win; infinite games are played in order to keep playing. 

Simon Sinek adopts this concept in his argument in *The Infinite Game* that [[Build organizations around a long-term narrative|organizations should adopt longer-term perspectives]]. 

Situations of [[¶ Radical uncertainty (King and Kay)|radical uncertainty]] are often "infinite games"; these also seem to align with "wicked domains."
