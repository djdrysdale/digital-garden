In remote work environments, it's easy for work to become invisible as tasks pile-up through unstructured, informal, and often invisible channels. For this reason, more attention needs to be paid at the managerial level to workload management and task management systems that don't pass the burden of time and energy management down to the individual contributor. Work needs to be made more visible and managed appropriately through well-designed systems, not just tools or technology.
