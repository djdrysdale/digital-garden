The "adjacent possible" describes the open space of direction that the future may take—the realm of the possible that is available at a given moment. Greater change is possible, but unlikely to extend beyond the adjacent space. Innovation doesn't happen in leaps and bounds, but occurs through [[Innovation accrues in small, incremental steps.|small, incremental steps]]. When ideas skip too far ahead beyond the "adjacent possible," they're unlikely to be adopted in the short-term. This is what we would call an idea that is "ahead of its time." They've skipped too far past the adjacent possible. 

[[Innovation thrives in open environments|Innovative environments]] help facilitate exploration of the adjacent possible and encourage the creative [[Ideas are remixes|recombination of ideas]]. 

[[Steven Johnson]] borrows the idea of the "adjacent possible" from [[Stuart Kauffman]], who used the term to describe how simple biological systems make small, incremental steps toward becoming complex systems. 

A somewhat related notion is that of a "proximate objective," used by Richard Rumelt to describe an objective that is close enough so as to be feasible.
