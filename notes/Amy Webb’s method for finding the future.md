Amy Webb's 6-step method for "finding the future": 

1. Finding the fringe: gather information and map the relationship between data points
2. Categorizing the pattern according to CIPHER (contradictions, inflections, practices, hacks, extremes, and rarities) 
3. Asking the right questions: Determine if a pattern is really a trend by creating counter-agents to [[Protect dissent|poke holes in the theory]]
4. Calculate the ETA: Monitor internal and external developments to assess how quickly the pattern is unfolding
5. Create probable, plausible, and probable scenarios and define an appropriate strategy
6. Pressure-test your strategy to determine if it is in fact effective
