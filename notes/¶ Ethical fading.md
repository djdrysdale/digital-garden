"Ethical fading" describes the cumulative result of accepting many small transgressions because they serve some short-term need. These many small acts accrue, and [[Organizations have become primarily focused on short-term results|may compromise long-term success]]. Furthermore, each small transgression makes the next easier to accept. 

This seems related to [[Metric fixation is a symptom of a decline in social trust|a relationship between metric fixation and trust]]; these are all bound up in short-term thinking at the cost of [[Build organizations around a long-term narrative|longer term aims]] and sustainability.
