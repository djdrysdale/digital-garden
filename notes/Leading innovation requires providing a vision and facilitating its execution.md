Innovation needs a clear strategic vision that can guide the work of its practitioners; this vision must align with the [[Integrate innovation functions with the broader organization|broader business strategy]]. The innovation leader's job is to facilitate the team's progress against that vision. They need to define what progress means in light of their strategic innovation agenda, and assemble, inspire, support, and reward an effective team. This means developing an appropriate framework for measuring success, as well as a plan for bringing successful products to market alongside the existing portfolio, and figuring how to integrate the outputs of the innovation practice into the organization's operating model.
