## Summary
Ladner outlines the different strengths and weaknesses of qualitative and quantitative research methods, providing a framework for leveraging the strengths of each approach. She suggests that the differences are more fundamental than simply an issue of data types; rather, they are informed by fundamental differences in the epistemological and ontological lenses that each approach takes.
