The third part of Richard Rumelt's [[Strategy revolves around a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.|kernel of strategy]] is coherent action. Coherent action is a set of coordinated activities, including resource allocations, initiatives, or projects that implement the [[Guiding policy is a general approach to overcoming a challenge|guiding policy]]. 

These activities must be coherent with one another: that is, they must be orchestrated, consistent, and coordinated. They cannot pull the organization in conflicting or even disparate directions. It is this coherence that gives the strategy its strength: without coherence, the organization does not have enough focus and is unable to create the leverage they need for their strategy to create a meaningful advantage. 

The coherent actions are how the organization applies strength against areas of weakness or toward the best opportunity.
