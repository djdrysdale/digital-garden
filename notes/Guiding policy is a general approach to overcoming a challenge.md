Guiding policy is a component of Richard Rumelt's [[Strategy revolves around a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.|kernel of strategy]]. It describes an overall approach to overcoming the challenge defined in the [[Strategic diagnosis is a clear, honest description of the challenge at hand|strategic diagnosis]] with the aim of creating leverage or developing an advantage.

The guiding policy does not define goals, visions, or blue sky end states; it outlines an approach to the problem and—most importantly—points toward some possibilities while ruling out others. It imposes constraints or guardrails on how the organization should solve the problem. 

A good guiding policy anticipates the actions of others, including competitors and consumers. 

Guiding policy helps simplify a complex situation into a clear path forward, which can be pursued through [[Strategy defines coherent action -- a set of coordinated moves that enact a guiding principle|a set of coherent actions]].
